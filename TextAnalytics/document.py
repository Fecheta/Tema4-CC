Update: rating reduced from 5 stars to 2 stars. This is due to me having to return the Laptop to Amazon and their returns policy. Whenever I’ve returned something I’ve had email conformation of receipt and refund issued within 24 hours.
For the return of this Laptop I’ve had to wait for the full 14 days, chase Amazon to confirm that they’ve actually received it, still says not received in my account even though customer services have confirmed they’ve got it. Now 14 days have passed I’ve got to contact Amazon on the 15th day so they can issue a manual refund as the system won’t allow this until after 14 days have passed.
My biggest concern is that they did not update my account to say that they’ve received the item, a few worried days thinking they could have lost it.

             I have used Macs for years and wouldn’t use anything else. However by the time I started to use this with my Adobe Photoshop editing it was an enormous let down. I cannot recall what I really didn’t like but it seemed no faster at all to me and it it also froze for no reason I could see. I’ll wait till the 22 models.

             This is the best Macbook laptop upgrade since 2014, in my honest opinion. From 2015 onwards, we saw Apple over-engineer elements of the Macbook, which was, frankly, unnecessary. It is great to see that the new Macbook is a giant leap in innovation, bringing back very needed functions such as multiple cable plugin options (3 USB-C, 1 HDMI, SD Card, MagCharger and Headphone jack).
